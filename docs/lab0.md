# Lab 0: Setting Up

## Register A CloudLab Account ([Link](https://www.cloudlab.us/signup.php?pid=cse453))
To register an account, please use your UW email and use UW NetID as the username. Upload your SSH public Key file as you will be using SSH to access the nodes in CloudLab. Click on `Submit Request`. We will approve your request within 24 hours. If you already have a CloudLab account, simply request to join the `cse453` project.

## Start An Experiment
To start a new experiment, go to your CloudLab dashboard and click on the `Experiments` tab in the upper left corner, then select `Start Experiment`. 
This will lead to the profile selection panel. Click on `Change Profile`, and select a profile from the list (TODO: provide more details on the profile). Click on `Next` to move to the next page. 
Here you should name your experiment with `<groupname>-<assignmentname>` (maybe there is a better way). The purpose of doing this is to prevent everyone from picking random names and ending up confusing each other since everyone in the project can see all running experiments.

(not sure if we should allow this) Optionally, You can specify from which cluster you want to start your experiment. Each cluster has a variety of hardware. For more information on the hardware CloudLab provides, please refer to this [page](http://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html). 

Once the experiment is created, you should be able to view the information under the [user dashboard page](https://www.cloudlab.us/user-dashboard.php). 

## Logging in 
Once the experiment is ready, click `List View` and you will find SSH command to access each node. (On the same tab, you can also reboot/reload your nodes if something goes wrong.)
