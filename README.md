# CSE453 Data Center Systems Project

Welcome to the CSE453 Data Center systems project. The project will
give you hands-on experience with many important data center
technologies. You will be investigating their features and performance
from a **data center operator's** perspective. You provide the cloud
to users and developers. Make them happy---the world counts on you!

The project is subdivided into five labs. For each lab _N_, you can
find its associated documentation in `docs/labN.md`. Happy learning!
