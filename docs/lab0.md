# Lab 0: Setting Up

This lab is ungraded and intended to get you set up with the project's
infrastructure. Please go through all the steps, make sure that each
one works, and that you have access to everything described here.

## Create a CloudLab Account ([Link](https://www.cloudlab.us/signup.php?pid=cse453))

The majority of the project runs on CloudLab, for which you need an
account. To create an account, please use your UW email and use UW
NetID as the username. Upload your SSH public key file as you will be
using SSH to access the nodes in CloudLab. Click on `Submit
Request`. We will approve your request within 24 hours. If you already
have a CloudLab account, simply request to join the `cse453` project.

## Start an Experiment

To start a new experiment, go to your CloudLab dashboard and click on
the `Experiments` tab in the upper left corner, then select `Start
Experiment`.  This will lead to the profile selection panel. Click on
`Change Profile`, and select a profile from the list (TODO: provide
more details on the profile). Click on `Next` to move to the next
page.  Here you should name your experiment with
`<groupname>-<assignmentname>` (maybe there is a better way). The
purpose of doing this is to prevent everyone from picking random names
and ending up confusing each other since everyone in the project can
see all running experiments.

You can specify from which cluster you want to start your
experiment. Each cluster has a variety of hardware. For more
information on the hardware CloudLab provides, please refer to this
[page](http://docs.cloudlab.us/hardware.html).

Once the experiment is created, you should be able to view the
information under the [user dashboard
page](https://www.cloudlab.us/user-dashboard.php).

## Logging in 

Once the experiment is ready, click `List View` and you will find SSH
commands to access each node. On the same tab, you can also
reboot/reload your nodes if something goes wrong.

## Policies on Using CloudLab Resources

1. Before you start your first experiment, please read this [page](https://cloudlab.us/aup.php). 
2. By default, each experiment will expire in 16 hours. Should we allow extension?
